I'm a new leargning developer, trying to study and understand coding, by taking a challenge, creating a Microsoft solution. 
I'm still unsure of what exaclty am I going to develop, so I'm gonna work on the idea here. I'm a fresh developer and this is my frist project

I'm studying:
Basic HTML, CSS and JS

I still don't know where to begin developing an API for Microsoft, I'll need more time to figure out

1- Learn how to use GitHub
2- Understand what to code regarding MS Office E5
